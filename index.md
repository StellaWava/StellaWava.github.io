##  DATA PROCESSING

### Web Scraping
In this project,I exploited the web crawling frameworks of scrapy, and requests packages to create custom pipelines to extract Airquality geospatial data from the EPA AirNow AirQuality monitoring website. The site host a vast amount of data, but the pipeline utilises the simplest workflow to collect and store data including FeatureClasses for data science investigation taks.
All code and processing were executed with Vscode IDE.

## BIG DATA SYSTEMS & ARCHITECTURE

#### COVID-19 Data Engineering System: How efficient were lock-down policies towards mitigating deaths?
The COVID-19 pandemic remains the pandemic of the century claiming over 7 million lives and leaving mostly many countries in devastating economic recessions.  In this project, I designed and implemented a comprehensive data engineering system to analyze post COVID-19 incident records and evaluate the efficiency of [lockdown policies](https://ourworldindata.org/metrics-explained-covid19-stringency-index) to mitigate deaths during through the period. Designed using GCP cloud resources, the system combined real-time and batch data processing to create advanced analytics and visualizations for actionable insights. Results indicated that only *China* total lockdown policy was effective in cubbing death rates. 
Tools used: *Apache Kafka*,*Hadoop HDFS, Apache Spark*, *Cloud Storage and BigQuery*, *Looker Studio*, and *Vertex AI* for autoML(boosted_trees).

## DATA MINING 
#### Exploring Alternative Fuel Stations & EV Charging Trends
The Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC) collects and stores data on alternative fueling stations across the U.S., providing vital information for consumers and businesses alike. In this project, I dive into this rich dataset, using _forecasting algorithms_ to uncover meaningful insights that can inform consumer decisions, including choosing the right car fuel model or planning driving routes. Additionally, these insights can be valuable for business strategies, such as optimizing station placement and infrastructure investments.

a) Types of EV Charging Stations & Their Distribution:

The majority of electric vehicle (ELEC) stations utilize Type J1772 connectors, with Level 2 charging available at over 2,740 stations. Figure 3 shows the distribution of these charging stations across the U.S., with Los Angeles leading in the number of Level 2 chargers. This data reveals important regional patterns in EV infrastructure development.

b) Predicting the Future Growth of ELEC Stations: 

Using the _Prophet Model_, I analyzed and forecasted the future trend of ELEC stations. Since 2010, there has been a significant rise in station openings due to the growing popularity of electric vehicles. Figure 4 illustrates this historical surge, while Figure 7 suggests that the rate of new station openings may slow in the coming years.

<!-- ## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my portfolio

Hello! My name is Stellamaris, and I set up this page to showcase my data mining project I've been working on.

In the past 7 years, I've studied at two of the world's best universities and worked in a variety of industries, gaining experience in data engineering, machine learning, strategy, analytics and management. My [CV](Nakacwa Stellamaris_RESUME_ta.pdf) has plenty of information about the professional projects I've worked on, but the purpose of this page is to showcase some of my favourite personal (on-the-side) projects in a more visual way. 

If you have any questions, feel free to drop me an [email](stellamarisus16@gmail.com) or send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/StellaWava/). 

Thanks for reading,

Stellaamaris
